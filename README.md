# Remote-Mouse
This is a java based project which allows any person to control their computer mouse using their android smart phone over a wi-fi network.<br>
<p>
For creating a wi-fi hotspot in a Windows enviroment run the commands: <br>
1. netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode = allow ssid = username key = password<br>
2. Press Enter<br>
3. netsh wlan start hostednetwork<br>
4. Press Enter<br>
</p>
<p>
For running the software compile and run server.java on your computer<br>
Enter the IP address of your computer into the app and click connect.<br>
The app will connect to the server using the Port 8080<br>
Now you can control your computer mouse using the app.<br>
GoodBye Mousepad! :)

Please suggest any modification or bugs in the software.
Cheers!
