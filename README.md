# Remote-Mouse
This is a java based project which allows any person to control their computer mouse using their android smart phone over a wi-fi network.
For creating a wi-fi hotspot in a Windows enviroment run the commands: 
1. netsh wlan set wifihotspot mode = allow ssid = <username> key = <password>
2. Press Enter
3. netsh wlan start wifihotspot
4. Press Enter

For running the software compile and run server.java on your computer
Enter the IP address of your computer into the app and click connect.
The app will connect to the server using the Port 8080
Now you can control your computer mouse using the app.
GoodBye Mousepad! :)

Please suggest any modification or bugs in the software.
Cheers!
